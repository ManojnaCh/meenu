Please, do even more than you can to intervene to save her. She is being put to death and nothing can justify her death. I have read all week about this case and I cannot accept that the US would allow this judge's decision to go uncontested, even though it is obvious he has not ruled fairly, wisely or democratically. One person's selfish wish cannot take precedence over the wishes of those who truly love Terri - her parents and family. They gave her her life and they are the ones with the most right to preserve her life against a tainted decision. I am extremely shocked by the unfairness shown by the US judicial system in treating this case. Judge Greer is not God, but has arrogantly acted as if he were. He only superficially examined some aspects, not all aspects of this case. He obviously preferred to give to honor Mr. Michael Schiavo's wishes only because Florida law gives him the right of ownership over his wife. She has not been considered as a separate individual with full rights to live simply because she is Terri and her human rights should be respected. They have not been respected. America cannot ignore that, as a helpless person, her interests have not been protected in any way. Judge Greer has considered and abided by the husband's wishes alone, and he has been very naive in not questioning the ulterior motives behind the husband's actions. Terri has had no true representation and it is just the husband's wish to see her die that has been respected here. No one can decide to impose death on another. I am not a judge, but I think I could have done a better job in assessing this case than Greer did. I look at the reasoning behind the judge's decision and all I see is that a blindly interpreted archaic law has condemned an innocent human being to death. If America cannot admit when a mistake has been committed by its judiciary and step in immediately to prevent a disastrous injustice from being commited against an innocent human being, it cannot call itself the most democratic and civilized country in the world. I can list at least 10 more civilized and democratic countries. The world is seeing a barbaric America I can assure you that no one here in Italy understands or justifies this ruling. I am ashamed for America. This helpless woman is lying in a bed dying a most atrocious death because one person, whose motives are dubious, wished it, and another permitted it stupidly. The case was judged only by one judge, Greer, in all these years! No other judge has been able to examine the case, and Greer would not step aside. This is obviously represented a conflict of interest for the family. It has been prejudicial to getting a fair intelligent ruling. No one has the right of possession over anyone because a state law says the husband can decide. How archaic! What if his intentions are less than altruistic? I dont' trust Mr. Schiavo's words or motives in this case. Terri has always breathed on her own and only needed a tube to feed her; how can that be reason for her life to be suppressed in this barbaric way? No one person should be able to subject another to such a thing! Where is America going with such decisions? No respect for human life becasue someone is disabled! A new genocide could come out of this. It's all very dangerous. I certainly do not think Terri would have wanted to die the way she is being made to die, amid atrocious suffering. What decent person could possibly feel they have the right to subject another person to this? Her life is being brutally suppressed. She is an innocent human being; how can that be justified any way you look at it? This is a prolonged and violent death Why must it be this way? The law must be exercised much more flexibly by intelligent people, not mentally rigid people, who can only cause disaster. I have been suffering for Terri's suffering all week. I am suffering for her parents. I had a terrible Easter thinking of her suffering. Some very arrogant American doctors spent last week telling us how Terri would die not feeling anything. I immediately asked myself if that could be true. Why didn't Greer? Why didn't he feel that would be unjust? Doctors here in Italy said that that was a pretty hazardous thing to say, because NO DOCTOR on earth can truly say what such patients really feel or do not feel, or understand. Think of the tremendous suffering being imposed on Terri should she realize what is happening, and I certainly believe she does realize it. A life that has been lived to a certain age, has things imprinted in its mind, and we have no way of knowng what she is aware of. It's a terrible fate to condemn Terri or anyone else to. Please STOP the torture and execution of Terri! Please STOP it in any way you can. Please ask President Bush and Congress to intervene. This is a very dangerous precedent for Ameica. But what is worse, Terri is dying unjustly and it is being brutally imposed through horrible suffering. PLEASE STOP THIS MADNESS ON THE PART OF ONE SELFISH PERSON AND ONE STUPID JUDGE. It takes a wise inbiased judge to come up with an intelligent ruling. Terri's parents have been unjustly disregarded from the beginning. Doctors arrogantly said she would feel nothing while dying, but we read now that she is receiving morphine to bear the effects of death rhrough starvation. Well, how come she is suffering if she was to feel nothing, and why is this torture being imposed on her? WHere are human rights in AMerica right now? This is a tremendous violation of her human rights. GOD HELP AMERICA for resigning itself to this execution. America cannot just justify killing like this - it will lead to other inconceivable rulings. Please SAVE TERRI. PLEASE, stop this brutal execution of an innocent person. STop saying she is not suffering or justfiying the rightness of this suffering because of a court ruling. It is WRONG. Please recognize when a mistake is leading to a disastrous crime against a helpless person and STOP IT. Please. Please listen to Terri's parents. The man has no right. He stopped being her husband when he decided to live with another woman and have children. He is no longer Terri's guardian. He only wants to protect his right to make claims and obtain what heis after materially. WHy didn't Greer question his new marriage and tell him he was living in bigamy? I thought they arrested people for that, or annuled the person's right to demand anything. He should and could have divorced and let her live with her parents. There was no need to demand her death! She has a right to live. It is a heinous crime against her. Only Terri's parents, who gave her life, should decide for the good of Terri. Anyone who demands to bring death on a person cannot be motivated by a wish to do good. They love her and want to care for her. Please do not prevent that by making Terri die. This is not a just ruling by a court. Dear Governor Bush, Please help these parents save their daughter. Do not turn a deaf ear to them. You are the only one who has the final say in death sentences; certainly you are able to intervene when a court ruling is unjust. It does not matter that it exists, what matters is what is right is that no wrong be done to Terri. Terri's death for NO GOOD REASON is horrendously WRONG. PLEASE save her. Please set right what the ruling has decided wrongly. Governor Bush, I keep seeing that you continue to announce that you can do nothing. You can, you have the final say. Please ask Pres. Bush and Congress to help you. Do not allow it to go beyond the point where death cannot be prevented. She is an innocent helpless person who cannot say what she wants; and no one on earth would want to die the way Terri is being made to die. You cannot call this a natural death and condone it, and then hypocritically say active euthanasia is wrong. This is inhuman torture. No one has any right to subject anyone else to this, whether an individual or the state! Please save Terri's life. I am unable to find other words to beg you to please SAVE TERRI from this brutal state torture and execution. That's all it is, and it must be stopped. No Italian judge would ever have allowed a husband to demand so much. The patient's rights to live would have been safeguarded first. The husband's motivations would have been questioned and investigated thoroughly. This was not done with Mr. Schiavo. He was given complete credit for everything he said, whether or not it is true. To me, Mr. Schiavo has been unable to prove what Terri wanted, but he was believed by judge Greer. Governor Bush, please let your conscience guide you and not political interests. Please SAVE TERRI's life. There is not mch time left. Please do what is good for Terri. Death is not what is good for Terri. Her parents want to love her and have her close to them. Please listen to them and ALLOW TERRI TO LIVE. Thank you. I pray for your intervention.

Dear Sir, REQUEST FOR AN URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP After due deliberation with my colleagues, We have decided to forward to you this business proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( $20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World Countries. This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The contract has since been executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract. We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for our own use. But under our protocol division, we as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This is why we are soliciting your assistance in this manner and regard . As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address from adverts in the business directory . I am the Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC ) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of us and I and one of my colleagues involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share, upon the confirmation from you that the Certified International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor. Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel No: +2348033026121. (Please fax,(234)1 7740434 OR MY AMERICAN E/FAX NUMBER +17752561718.Your indication by revert Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax you or brief you of the PROCEDURES FOR THIS TRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get through. NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please inform us so that we can look for another reliable person who can assist in this respect. It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this transaction. Be further informed that everyone's interest and security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured and feel free to go into this transaction with us.

Did you know that there aren't any scholarships for learning disabled students that aren't tied to the same GPA's as all other scholarships? And the few that we did find were only for students who had not yet entered the system. The fact that they are disabled in attaining these GPA's is simply ignored. He has obtained a few student loans but even those were withheld when his GPA dropped below the guidelines set for all student loans. I assume that the reason no one has ever tackled this issue is because most learning disabled students never attempt college and if they do they can't muddle through the scholarship and loan processes that are required. But - if is skin color or gender were different, there would have been all sorts of opportunities available.

Recent events give us the opportunity to analyze and reflect upon some of the most serious faults with the management and administration of the Florida department of corrections. The two events we wish to look at are the retention and employment of a person who may well have committed sexual battery and was, in fact, sentenced to five consecutive one-year terms of probation and the firing of a person who has committed no offenses other than to speak the truth about the corrupt management and administration of the Florida department of corrections. Looking at these incidents, we must ask, \"What is important to the people of Florida?\" We must ask, \"What is in the best interest of the people Florida?\" Is it in the best interest of the citizens of Florida for the corrupt department of corrections administrators to maintain a person on the payroll in the position of probation supervisor who is a sentenced law breaker? Is it in the best interests of the citizens of Florida that a sentenced offender be in a supervisory position over sworn law enforcement officers? Our answer to those last two questions is a resounding, \"No!\" We must also ask the Florida Commission on Standards and Training for law-enforcement officers if they believe such behavior by the Florida Department Corrections is in compliance with the rules and standards for law-enforcement officers and agencies within the state of Florida. We will be addressing that question directly to commission within the next week. It is beyond understanding how the offender can maintain his law-enforcement certification after serving probation sentences for his crimes. We do not understand how the Florida department corrections can possibly justify their actions in allowing Willie Jenkins to be employed in any position requiring law-enforcement certification. What we believe is that the offender Willie Jenkins maintains his employment due to the corrupt and unethical behavior of Harry Singletary and the region four administrator. We believe that the biggest factor in the retention of Willie Jenkins is the fact that he is a black man and he receives unethical and preferential treatment from the region four director, who is a white woman trying to further curry favor from Singletary, and Secretary Singletary of the Florida department of corrections, who is a black man. We know this behavior by the department of corrections administrators is unethical, dishonest, and reprehensible. We believe it is illegal. Therefore, a copy of this editorial will be forwarded to Governor Chiles and Governor elect Bush as well as the Office of the Attorney General. Perhaps they can right this grievous wrong done to the citizens of Florida by the corrupt administrators of the Florida department corrections. We now turn our attention to the firing of senior probation officer James Church. Of what offenses has Church been convicted or sentenced? The answer is, obviously, none. It is apparent, though, that Church committed many offenses. He dared to speak the truth and about the corrupt administrators of the Florida department corrections. He dared to publish that truth in a public forum. He wrote letters to the elected officials of the state government of Florida. He showed that the policies enacted by the corrupt and inept administrators worked against accomplishing the legislative goals of the department corrections. He wrote the truth and spoke the truth about administrators within the Florida department corrections regardless of their rank, race, or political affiliation. He refused to be intimidated or silenced by threats from administrators, retaliatory transfers, or denials of promotions for which he was obviously the most qualified and the best candidate. He gave other employees the opportunity to point out injustices done to them by the corrupt administrators of Florida department corrections. How dare he do such things? What then may we learn by looking at the actions of the Florida department corrections' administrators in the these cases? We may learn what is important to the administrators. We may learn what type of behaviors are rewarded by the administrators. We may learn what type of individuals are sought and maintained by the administrators. What is important? Apparently law abiding behavior is not important to the administrators. Apparently compliance with the standards and training commission is not important. Apparently off duty behavior by certain select and protected races and ranks within the department are not important. That these things are not important is evidenced by the cover-up and corrupt behavior of the department administrators in shielding Willie Jenkins from the consequences of his actions and by maintaining him on the payroll. Looking at Church's situation, what can be determined regarding what is important to department administrators? We can determine the courage is not important. We can determine that honesty is not important. We can determine that the effectiveness of the department in providing rehabilitation is not important. We can determine that leadership is not important. We can determine that ethical behavior is not important. We can determine that an officer's adherence to his oath is not important. So, having determined that the above behaviors, qualities, and characteristics are not important to the administrators of the Florida Department of Corrections, we again ask, \"What is important?\" The evidence leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the following things are those things most important to the administrators of the Florida department corrections. 1. Do what you are told without question. 2. Keep your mouth shut about the problems in the department corrections. 3. Never criticize management decisions. 4. Do not try to make things better. 5. Never make waves. 6. Do not point out corrupt or unethical behavior committed by administrators. Those are the unwritten laws of the Florida department of corrections. As the Willie Jenkins/James Church incidents show, you can break the laws of Florida and corrupt administrators will shelter and protect you. If you break the secret laws of the Florida department of corrections, the corrupt administrators will fire you. It is obvious that the administrators have come to believe that they are somehow above the law and that their wishes and desires are more important than the law, their oaths of office, or the well-being of the citizens of Florida. As long as the Governor, the Legislature, and citizens of Florida permit the unethical and corrupt practices of the administrators of the Florida department of corrections to continue, they prove that the administrators are right to believe they are somehow above the law. ________ I thank the writer for this editorial. And I agree with his/her points. The Florida Department of Corrections is a dysfunctional organization filled with corrupt administrators. We must fight on to bring about change for the sake of our children. Right now DC administrators are making things worse. They are not providing rehabilitation for the offenders. Rather, they have sunk to offender behavior levels themselves. It is like a child molester working in a kindergarten. The evil that they do may not be known for years, but it is evil nonetheless. JLC (to the writer, I changed some of your wording, because I thought it was unclear in places. If I have changed what you were trying to get across, let me know and I will change it back.)

We may\nlearn what type of behaviors are rewarded by the administrators.\u00a0 We may\nlearn what type of\nindividuals are sought and maintained by the administrators.\n\n\nWhat is important? Apparently law abiding behavior is not important to\nthe administrators.\nApparently compliance with the standards and training commission is not\nimportant. Apparently\noff duty behavior by certain select and protected races and ranks within<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">\n</div>the department are not\nimportant.\u00a0 That these things are not important is evidenced by the\ncover-up and corrupt behavior\nof the department administrators in shielding <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"willie jenkins\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">Willie Jenkins </div>from the\nconsequences of his actions\nand by maintaining him on the payroll.\n\n\nLooking at <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"church\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">Church</div>'s situation, what can be determined regarding what is\nimportant to department\nadministrators?\u00a0 We can determine the courage is not important.\u00a0 We can\ndetermine that honesty\nis not important.\u00a0 We can determine that the effectiveness of the\ndepartment in providing\nrehabilitation is not important.\u00a0 We can determine that leadership is\nnot important.\u00a0 We can\ndetermine that ethical behavior is not important.\u00a0 We can determine that\nan officer's adherence to\nhis oath is not important.\n\n\nSo, having determined that the above behaviors, qualities, and\ncharacteristics are not important\nto the administrators of <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"the florida department of corrections\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">the Florida Department of Corrections</div>, we again\nask, \"What is\nimportant?\"\u00a0 The evidence leads us to the inescapable conclusion that\nthe following things are\nthose things most important to the administrators of the <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">Florida\n</div>department corrections.\n\n\n<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"1\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">1</div>.

management of the Florida Department of Corrections. For more information, please visit our web pages: http://www.cde.com/~jlchurch but for now, please read the following: The Facts of the Willie Jenkins case My trip to Miami was productive. I now have copies of the information filed against Willie Jenkins in Dade County case 94 - 38882. The information we originally received from region four indicated that Jenkins had been charged with five counts of sexual battery. That was true. However, those charges were only part of what the offender was charged with. The following were the original charges in this case: Count 1. Burglary with assault therein, Count 2. Kidnaping, Counts 3. through 7 Sexual Battery, Counts 8. through 15. Violation of injunction against domestic violence, Counts 16. and 17. Battery, Count 18. Petty Theft, and finally, Count 19 Criminal Mischief of two hundred dollars or less. Here, according to the investigating officer's report, is what happened when Jenkins committed these offenses. (The victim's name will be omitted.) On Friday, Nov. 10, 1994, at approximately 1 a.m. detective Ralph A. Hernandez was assigned to investigate a domestic related sexual battery. His investigation revealed that the victim had been separated from her husband approximately four months. On Thursday, Nov. 9, 1994, at about 10:30 p.m. the offender came to the victim's house in violation of the domestic injunction. Jenkins forced way into the apartment then went to the victim's bedroom where he tried to retrieve messages from the victim's answering machine. When he was unable to retrieve messages, he threw the answering machine to the floor, breaking the machine. The subject then grabbed the victim by her arms and pushed her down onto the bed. He then ripped off the victim's panties and told her he was going to fuck her \"one last time.\" The victim tried to escape, but the subject grabbed her and pulled back into bed. The subject ordered the victim to kiss him but she refused. The subject then bit the victim on the left side of her mouth causing an injury. At that point, Jenkins forced the victim's legs up over her head and performed oral sex on her. He then took his penis from his pants and raped her vaginally. After a time, Jenkins rolled the victim onto her stomach and tried to sodomize her. He pushed a finger into her rectum in the effort to loosen it so he could insert is penis. However, the victim's struggles prevented him from making penile penetration into her anus. At that point, the victim broke away and tried to run from the bedroom. Jenkins caught her and threw her back on the bed and began to rape her again. He continued the rape until he ejaculated. Once he had ejaculated, he rolled off the victim and she again broke free. She ran from the room and went to the kitchen where she dialed 911. Jenkins came into the kitchen, took the phone from her, and hung it up. The 911 operator called the number back and said police were on their way. When he knew officers would soon be there, Jenkins fled the scene. Subsequent investigation at the hospital produced evidence of a sexual attack on the victim. There was semen in her vagina, bruises on her arms and other parts of her body, and an injury to her mouth where the offender bit her. It is also interesting to note that on the arrest warrant in the comments section, the following is stated, \"Considered armed and suicidal.\" Count 3 of the probation order states, \"You will pay the state of Florida the amount of fifty dollars per month toward the cost of your supervision, unless otherwise waived in compliance with Florida Statutes.\" According to the department of corrections records, Willie Jenkins paid no cost of supervision. I was unable to find a copy of an order for the modification to probation to delete cost to supervision. Furthermore, there can be no justification for the person who supposedly supervised Jenkins on probation for approaching the court to delete the cost of supervision. Jenkins was working, making over 30 thousand dollars per year. There is no way he could qualify for a waiver of cost supervision. On Sept. 15, 1997, Barry Groves sent a letter to judge Paul Siegel along with an order for termination of probation asking that this offender's probation be terminated after serving only approximately 20 percent of his sentence. That Groves would send such a letter and make such a motion is an indication of the depth of the corruption and the unethical behavior of the Florida department of corrections' administrators. The offender Willie Jenkins is a sex offender. It is the policy of the Florida department of corrections that an officer will not recommend an early termination of probation for sex offenders. It is also the policy of the Florida department of corrections that officers will not recommend an early termination of probation until the offender has served at least half of his sentence. The corrupt and unethical behavior exhibited by department managers in this case is a disgrace to the whole department of corrections. There are no excuses. Since the supervising person in this case was a deputy circuit administrator, the circuit administrators had to know and approve of the request for only termination and for the apparent request for a waiver of cost of supervision. These behaviors by the administrators are glaring illustrations of the corruption which plagues the department of corrections under the so - called leadership of Harry K. Singletary and his morally bankrupt administrators. This incident also shows that DC administrators care nothing about public safety when public safety conflicts with their own agendas or desires.", "recipient_name": "Jeb Bush", "display_text": "Dear <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Florida </div>legislators:\nWe thought you should all be aware of the corruption which exists and\nthrives in the management of <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"the florida department of corrections\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">the Florida Department of Corrections</div>.\u00a0\nFor more information, please visit our web pages:\nhttp://www.cde.com/~jlchurch\nbut for now, please read the following:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Facts of the <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"willie jenkins\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">Willie Jenkins </div>case\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy trip to <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"miami\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Miami </div>was productive.

When he was unable to\nretrieve messages, he threw the\nanswering machine to the floor, breaking the machine. The subject then\ngrabbed the victim by her arms\nand pushed her down onto the bed. He then ripped off the victim's panties\nand told her he was going\nto fuck her \"<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"one\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">one </div>last time.\"\nThe victim tried to escape, but the subject grabbed her and pulled back\ninto bed. The subject ordered\nthe victim to kiss him but she refused. The subject then bit the victim\non the left side of her mouth\ncausing an injury. At that point, <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"jenkins\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">Jenkins </div>forced the victim's legs\nup over her head and performed oral\nsex on her. He then took his penis from his pants and raped her vaginally.\nAfter a time, <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"jenkins\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">Jenkins </div>rolled the victim onto her stomach and tried to\nsodomize her. He pushed a finger\ninto her rectum in the effort to loosen it so he could insert is penis.\nHowever, the victim's struggles\nprevented him from making penile penetration into her anus. At that\npoint, the victim broke away and\ntried to run from the bedroom. <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"jenkins\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">Jenkins </div>caught her and threw her back\non the bed and began to rape\nher again.

"clean_text": "Why the Florida department corrections will continue to fail in its mission. by James Church The ineffectiveness of the Florida department corrections is a function and a result of the dysfunctional management system which is ingrained and maintained by department administrators. These administrators protect and maintain the system because understanding and adhering to the system are how the administrators gained their positions. With each promotion they received, they became more dedicated to preserving the system that rewarded them. That is human nature. Furthermore, psychological research has shown that the most effective reinforcement system is variable interval reward. The promotional process in the department corrections is a variable interval system. What that means is that there is no way of knowing how many times one must apply for a promotion and interview for a promotion before getting a promotion. Soon individuals began striving for the promotions as ends in themselves. When this happens, employees lose sight of the true aim of their jobs. The aim becomes the promotion rather than accomplishing the tasks of the job. Once the aim of employment has been perverted, the workers' effectiveness as well as the effectiveness of the organization as a whole decreases dramatically, and the organization becomes self-defeating. The Florida Department Corrections is such an organization. It is self-defeating, and it is ineffective in performing the tasks it is assigned. In the book the Self-Defeating Organization written by Robert E. Harding and Randy Schwartz, on page 93, the authors say: Insanity has sometimes been described as doing the same thing over and over and expecting to achieve a different result. Substitute ineffectiveness for insanity and you have, in a sentence, the plight of the chronically unsuccessful organization. At once apprehensive and hidebound, the self-defeating organization resorts time and again to ostensible solutions that have failed it so often in the past. It's almost as if the leaders of these organizations are pinning their hopes on some quasi-divine intervention - or, failing that, on an extremely fortuitous turn of events. And when, predictably, the miracle or the lucky break fails to materialize, organizational decision-makers scurry back to the drawing board, usually to sketch the outlines of a strategy remarkably similar to the one that has just failed. The risk classification system is a prime example of this type of self-defeating behavior. For at least a decade prior to the risk classification system's implementation, the probation division operated on another risk classification system which was time driven rather than factor driven. Year after year department administrators could look at the figures for recidivism, new crimes, revocation of supervision, and employee turnover and see that probation services were ineffective and that little or no rehabilitation was taking place within the offender population. The numbers were there, and if you ask the department administrators, they will tell you that they read and reviewed the reports and the figures those reports contained. The same behavior continues within the ranks of the department administrators even now. Historical data shows that imposing arbitrary contact standards for probation cases produces no positive results. Nevertheless when the department implemented the risk classification system, the administrators once again imposed arbitrary contact standards on probation cases. Why did they do this? The obvious answer is stupidity. However, the answer is more complicated than that. While we believe that the great majority of administrators have at least average intelligence, they are unable to break the cycle they have established in their careers. That cycle revolves around obtaining promotions, recognition, and peer approval, while ignoring completely the issue of effectiveness, especially organization effectiveness, in performing the legislated tasks of the Florida Department of Corrections. That this is so should surprise no one who has taken the time to look at and evaluate the management and the business practices of the Florida Department of Corrections. The one thing that is never quantified, measured, or evaluated is employee effectiveness in providing or facilitating rehabilitation in the offender population. The department managers are so intent upon justifying their positions; receiving the promotions, recognition, and peer approval noted above; and protecting the system that has elevated them that they have never taken the most basic steps toward providing effective \"Corrections\" or rehabilitation. That most basic step would be to determine what factors actually contribute to rehabilitation. Why have department administrators never done that? We believe it is because they know they contribute absolutely nothing to any rehabilitation which actually occurs within the offender population. They know that rehabilitation occurs, or fails to occur, as a result of the interaction between the offender and the department of corrections' employees with which the offender interacts the most. In probation that would be probation officers, and in prison that would be corrections officers. So on the bottom line, department administrators know that they are ineffective and that they contribute nothing toward the legislated mission of the Florida department corrections which is, of course, corrections or rehabilitation. It is this gut-level knowledge which administrators have of their own uselessness which causes them to implement policies and procedures with which they hope to justify their positions, gain peer approval, and earn promotions. What the department and the employees gain from the administrators' attempts to prove themselves necessary are waste, useless programs, absurd policies, employee turnover, and low morale. The citizens of Florida are penalized by having millions of their tax dollars wasted, increased risk of injury from offenders, and the costs of damage to their persons and to their property. The offenders pay a price because they fail to receive effective interventions from the Department of Corrections which might have assisted them in turning away from a life of crime and becoming more productive members of society. So, with the present management system of the Florida department of corrections, everyone in Florida loses except the dysfunctional managers of the Florida Department of the Corrections.", "recipient_name": "Jeb Bush", "display_text": "Why the <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Florida </div>department corrections will continue to fail in its mission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nby<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"james church\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJames Church\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </div>The ineffectiveness of the <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Florida </div>department corrections\nis a function and a result of the\ndysfunctional management system which is ingrained and maintained by<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">\n</div>department administrators.\nThese administrators protect and maintain the system because understanding\nand adhering to the\nsystem are how the administrators gained their positions.

The aim becomes the promotion rather than accomplishing\nthe tasks of the job.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once the aim of employment has been perverted, the\nworkers' effectiveness as well as the\neffectiveness of the organization as a whole decreases dramatically,\nand the organization becomes\nself-defeating. <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"the florida department corrections\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">The Florida Department Corrections </div>is such an organization.\nIt is self-defeating, and it is\nineffective in performing the tasks it is assigned.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the book <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"the selfdefeating organization\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">the Self-Defeating Organization </div>written\nby <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"robert e harding\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">Robert E. Harding </div>and <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"randy schwartz\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">Randy Schwartz</div>, on<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"page 93\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">\npage 93</div>, the authors say:\nInsanity has sometimes been described as doing the same thing over\nand over and expecting to\nachieve a different result. Substitute ineffectiveness for insanity\nand you have, in a sentence, the\nplight of the chronically unsuccessful organization. At once apprehensive\nand hidebound, the\nself-defeating organization resorts time and again to ostensible\nsolutions that have failed it so often\nin the past. It's almost as if the leaders of these organizations\nare pinning their hopes on some\nquasi-divine intervention - or,<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">\u00a0 </div>failing that, on an extremely\nfortuitous turn of events.\u00a0 And when,\npredictably, the miracle or the lucky break fails to materialize,\norganizational decision-makers\nscurry back to the drawing board, usually to sketch the outlines\nof a strategy remarkably similar to\nthe one that has just failed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The risk classification system is a prime example\nof this type of self-defeating behavior. For at least\n<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"a decade\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">a decade </div>prior to the risk classification system's implementation,\nthe probation division operated on\nanother risk classification system which was time driven rather than\nfactor driven. Year after <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"year\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">year\n</div>department administrators could look at the figures for recidivism,\nnew crimes, revocation of\nsupervision, and employee turnover and see that probation services\nwere ineffective and that little or\nno rehabilitation was taking place within the offender population.\nThe numbers were there, and if you\nask the department administrators, they will tell you that they read<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">\n</div>and reviewed the reports and the\nfigures those reports contained.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same behavior continues within the ranks of the\ndepartment administrators even now. Historical\ndata shows that imposing arbitrary contact standards for probation<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">\n</div>cases produces no positive results.\nNevertheless when the department implemented the risk classification\nsystem, the administrators once\nagain imposed arbitrary contact standards on probation cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why did they do this? The obvious answer is stupidity.\nHowever, the answer is more complicated\nthan that. While we believe that the great majority of administrators\nhave at least average intelligence,\nthey are unable to break the cycle they have established in their careers.\nThat cycle revolves around\nobtaining promotions, recognition, and peer approval, while ignoring\ncompletely the issue of\neffectiveness, especially organization effectiveness, in performing\nthe legislated tasks of the <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\ndepartment of corrections\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">Florida\nDepartment of Corrections</div>.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That this is so should surprise no one who has taken\nthe time to look at and evaluate the\nmanagement and the business practices of <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"the florida department of\ncorrections\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">the Florida Department of\nCorrections</div>. The <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"one\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">one </div>thing that is\nnever quantified, measured, or evaluated is employee effectiveness\nin providing or facilitating\nrehabilitation in the offender population. The department managers\nare so intent upon justifying their\npositions; receiving the promotions, recognition, and peer approval\nnoted above; and protecting the\nsystem that has elevated them that they have never taken the most basic\nsteps toward providing\neffective \"Corrections\" or rehabilitation. That most basic step would\nbe to determine what factors\nactually contribute to rehabilitation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why have department administrators never done that?\nWe believe it is because they know they\ncontribute absolutely nothing to any rehabilitation which actually\noccurs within the offender population.\nThey know that rehabilitation occurs, or fails to occur, as a result\nof the interaction between the\noffender and the department of corrections' employees with which the\noffender interacts the most. In<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">\n</div>probation that would be probation officers, and in prison that would\nbe corrections officers. So on the\nbottom line, department administrators know that they are ineffective\nand that they contribute nothing\ntoward the legislated mission of the <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Florida </div>department corrections\nwhich is, of course, corrections or\nrehabilitation.\n\u00a0\nIt is this gut-level knowledge which administrators have of their own\nuselessness which causes them to\nimplement policies and procedures with which they hope to justify their\npositions, gain peer approval,\nand earn promotions. What the department and the employees gain from<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">\n</div>the administrators' attempts\nto prove themselves necessary are waste, useless programs, absurd policies,\nemployee turnover, and\nlow morale. The citizens of <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Florida </div>are penalized by having <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"millions\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">millions\n</div>of their tax dollars wasted,\nincreased risk of injury from offenders, and the costs of damage to<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">\n</div>their persons and to their property.\nThe offenders pay a price because they fail to receive effective interventions\nfrom <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"the department of\ncorrections\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">the Department of\nCorrections </div>which might have assisted them in turning away from a life\nof crime and becoming more\nproductive members of society. So, with the present management system\nof the <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Florida </div>department of\ncorrections, everyone in <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"florida\" data-ent-type=\"GPE\">Florida </div>loses except the dysfunctional managers\nof <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"the florida department of\"

I do not know the party affiliation of either, and to be honest, I don't think it would matter in either case as far as their doing the job. In no particular order: Richard Harvey. Former director of the Division of Water Facilities. In private engineering practice for awhile, he is now with the US EPA Everglades office. Richard is one of the finest managers I have ever served under. The DEP everglades office could get you his number. Dan Thompson. Former General Counsel for DEP, also served as deputy secretary of the \"environmental\" side after the merger between DER and DNR to form DEP. Currently practicing law, but he may have left Tallahassee. I last saw him in the Orlando airport a couple of years ago. DEP's OGC office probably has a number for him.

What an honor!. Do things happen by coincidence, or is it HIS plan for then to happen the way they do? Why do this extraordinary and so orderly \"planned\" things happen to me? Why me? I heard what senator Mack said yesterday, that in HIS eyes we are all the same I agree with him, but in this world, I am just a simple citizen that is having some unexplainable experiences. I can understand when you say that it is \"a humbling experience\". When I found out that Lucy had so many \"exceptionalities\" (special needs), I asked, Why me? I still do not know, but the picture gets a little cleared as the years go by. I just let him guide me. He knows better than me what my destiny is. Yesterday, I asked my self: How did this happen? We just wanted to see your office. We walk into to it to see it, and all of a sudden you are there with your whole family, and we have the GREAT HONOR & PRIVILEGE of meeting your parents, and a few or your brothers. How in the world did that happen? It was not planned? We didn't mean to intrude in your personal matters. We just wanted to see your office. Later on, as we are talking with a friend, none other than Ms. Gema Hernandez introduces herself to us. Can you believe this? One of you appointed cabinet members introduces herself to us! This was specially meaningful to me, because a few years back I tried contacting her about a conference that I was planning, but was never able to communicate with her. When I saw the news about her appointment, I told Milton that I had her name and number in my address book. I was so excited when meet her, and told her about my connection whit her. As if all of that was not enough for one day, I asked her about Judge Kearny, and she indicated that she was seating behind her, so when the ceremony ended, I went to introduce myself to her, and it was as if we had already known each other for a long time. How in the world did this \"girl\" from Barranquilla, Colombia ended up being the governors friend, and meeting all your family, and two of your cabinet members? Is this a coincidence, or was it meant to be? I do not know why this whole experiences makes me feel so humble, so little... I can not explain the feeling, but it's there. Again, I want to tell you that if there is ever anything in which I could ever assist you, your government, and/or the people of Florida with, it will me my honor, my pleasure and a privilege. I do not expect anything directly from you in return. The rewards are built into the experience of doing what I love to do, which is advocating for the rights of those that can not always directly advocate for themselves.

getting back from the wonderful Inaugural events and as I listened intently to your message and vision, I recommitted myself to the same public service values of humility, inclusion, respect, integrity and honor that you embody. If we ,as a citizenry and public servants can adopt these values you are living as our Governor, we can become the state you envision and described. As to your request for recommendation to the South Florida Water Management District Board, I am honored that you would consider my thoughts and realize there are more important and knowledgeable people than I inundating you with advice and they should carry more weight than mine I am sure. Out of respect and a sincere interest in responding to you in any way that I may be helpful, I recommend Kevin McCarty from Palm Beach County to bring some Financial and Fiscal understanding to the Board, Mike Collins from Monroe County to provide the Environmental perspective to assure Florida Bay, The Everglades and the Everglades Buffer strip are a continued focus and Kathy Milledge ( a former senior Manager) to bring institutional knowledge and represent Agriculture and Economic impact issues. You are getting many recommendations to reappoint Gene Pettis so he can assume the Chairmanship position and he is a strong and honorable member but has not demonstrated the fiscal responsibility and public service mission focussed philosophy necessary to turn this agency around. He invited the IT lawsuit that we recently had to settle for over $1.2 million in legal expenses and as Chairman of the Audit Committee has watched the dismantling of the Financial management of the District. As an example our District is probably the only agency that has removed the Procurement function from Finance and put it under Office of Business Resources ( Human Resource managers) rather than under the Chief Financial Officer. Procurement is focussed on the Social agenda of the Board rather than on the responsible fiscal control of taxpayer dollars! A dangerous initiative that will result in poor financial management decisions and results. We have three democrat, attorneys on the Board at the present time and if it is important to reappoint Mr. Pettis than one of the others should resign so we can begin to achieve a more appropriate balance and a Board that reflects your direction. It is rumored that we will be getting a new Executive Director and there are two names that may have adequate background and ability to fill the interim Director position for 6 - 12 months until the new Board can be educated to the issues and select a permanent Director and they are one insider, Bill Malone the present Director of Construction and Land Management and one outsider (but former Planning Department Director) Jim Harvey, Executive Director of Florida Bay Initiative.

say..\n\nGood morning Governor, I am just getting back from the wonderful Inaugural\nevents and as I listened intently to your message and vision, I recommitted\nmyself to the same public service values of humility, inclusion, respect,\nintegrity and honor that you embody. If we ,as a citizenry and public servants\ncan adopt these values you are living as our Governor, we can become the state\nyou envision and described. As to your request for recommendation to the South\nFlorida Water Management District Board, I am honored that you would consider\nmy thoughts and realize there are more important and knowledgeable people than\nI inundating you with advice and they should carry more weight than mine I am\nsure. Out of respect\u00a0 and a sincere interest in responding to you in any way\nthat I may be helpful, I recommend Kevin McCarty from Palm Beach County to\nbring some Financial and Fiscal understanding to the Board, Mike Collins from\nMonroe County to provide the Environmental perspective to assure Florida Bay,\nThe Everglades and the Everglades Buffer strip are a continued focus and Kathy\nMilledge ( a former senior Manager) to bring institutional knowledge and\nrepresent Agriculture and Economic impact issues. You are getting many\nrecommendations to reappoint Gene Pettis so he can assume the Chairmanship\nposition and he is a strong and honorable member but has not demonstrated the\nfiscal responsibility and public service mission focussed philosophy necessary\nto turn this agency around. He invited the IT lawsuit that we recently had to\nsettle for over $1.2 million in legal expenses and as Chairman of the Audit\nCommittee has watched the dismantling of the Financial management of the\nDistrict. As an example our District is probably the only agency that has\nremoved the Procurement function from Finance and put it under Office of\nBusiness Resources ( Human Resource managers) rather than under the Chief\nFinancial Officer. Procurement is focussed on the Social agenda of the Board\nrather than on the responsible fiscal control of taxpayer dollars! A dangerous\ninitiative that will result in poor financial management decisions and\nresults. We have three democrat, attorneys on the Board at the present time\nand if it is important to reappoint Mr. Pettis than one of the others should\nresign so we can begin to achieve a more appropriate balance and a Board that\nreflects your direction. It is rumored that we will be getting a new Executive\nDirector and there are two names that may have adequate background and ability\nto fill the interim Director position for 6 - 12 months until the new Board\ncan be educated to the issues and select a permanent Director and they are one\ninsider, Bill Malone the present Director of Construction and Land Management\nand one outsider (but former Planning Department Director) Jim Harvey,\nExecutive Director of Florida Bay Initiative. Thanks you for this opportunity\nto reply and I hope I have not been to presumptious in my remarks but I want\nyou to be assured I did not take any opportunity to communicate with you\nlightly.

It touched on broad values and goals without being a\nlaundry list of projects. I got a really good feeling listening to\nwhat you were saying. I hope that the stress and burden of the job\nkeep you opne to idaes and free from the shackles of the institution\nthat will necessarily start to close in.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I eschewed my classy seats to stand in the middle of the\nstreet where it was warmer - - based on later reviews of\nquasi-frost-bitten dignataries, the best decision.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 I enjoyed seeing you at the reception but had to duck out to\ncatch a plane. During the day, I had the opportunity to meet privately\nwith the House Leadership and was extremely impressed. They seem\ninterested in helping you with your programand goals; they seem\u00a0\nbright, dedicated, and without personal agendas that are at cross\npurposes with what you have publicly outlined.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 I wish you every success as you start this venture and would\noffer only one point of practical advice, as there clearly is no need\nfor basic advice with the wealth of resource in your family.\u00a0 \u00a0 As a\nCEO, you need to find a place and a time when you can get away and\njust think - - without aides, friends, family, colleagues, or\nsupplicants. Any company gets its\u00a0 top value from its CEO when that\nindividual has break in his or her schedule when thinking and playing\nwith ideas can take place. Otherwise, the CEOI becomes a COO, and the\norganization and its owners suffer. It is a conclusion that I have\nstubbornly put off, but now understand that\u00a0 it is right, as I have\ngotten to a point where if I do not do that, I become jaded, bored,\nlistless, and ineffective.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You have a unique platform to carry out your plan. You are a\nRepublican who has co-opted the heart of the Democratic issues. I do\nbelieve that you will accomplish a lot, but I also believe that the\nstate's most critical need is to solve the education problem before it\nreally hurts the inflow of business, and a voucher plan can not only\nempower the poor with economic clout, it can make the educational\ndollar go farther and farther.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Good luck and continue to listen to the Big Adviser in the Sky!\n\nP.S.

If we ,as a citizenry and public\nservants\ncan adopt these values you are living as our Governor, we can become the\nstate\nyou envision and described. As to your request for recommendation to the\nSouth\nFlorida Water Management District Board, I am honored that you would\nconsider\nmy thoughts and realize there are more important and knowledgeable people\nthan\nI inundating you with advice and they should carry more weight than mine I\nam\nsure. Out of respect\u00a0 and a sincere interest in responding to you in any way\nthat I may be helpful, I recommend Kevin McCarty from Palm Beach County to\nbring some Financial and Fiscal understanding to the Board, Mike Collins\nfrom\nMonroe County to provide the Environmental perspective to assure Florida\nBay,\nThe Everglades and the Everglades Buffer strip are a continued focus and\nKathy\nMilledge ( a former senior Manager) to bring institutional knowledge and\nrepresent Agriculture and Economic impact issues. You are getting many\nrecommendations to reappoint Gene Pettis so he can assume the Chairmanship\nposition and he is a strong and honorable member but has not demonstrated\nthe\nfiscal responsibility and public service mission focussed philosophy\nnecessary\nto turn this agency around. He invited the IT lawsuit that we recently had\nto\nsettle for over $1.2 million in legal expenses and as Chairman of the Audit\nCommittee has watched the dismantling of the Financial management of the\nDistrict. As an example our District is probably the only agency that has\nremoved the Procurement function from Finance and put it under Office of\nBusiness Resources ( Human Resource managers) rather than under the Chief\nFinancial Officer. Procurement is focussed on the Social agenda of the Board\nrather than on the responsible fiscal control of taxpayer dollars! A\ndangerous\ninitiative that will result in poor financial management decisions and\nresults. We have three democrat, attorneys on the Board at the present time\nand if it is important to reappoint Mr. Pettis than one of the others should\nresign so we can begin to achieve a more appropriate balance and a Board\nthat\nreflects your direction. It is rumored that we will be getting a new\nExecutive\nDirector and there are two names that may have adequate background and\nability\nto fill the interim Director position for 6 - 12 months until the new Board\ncan be educated to the issues and select a permanent Director and they are\none\ninsider, Bill Malone the present Director of Construction and Land\nManagement\nand one outsider (but former Planning Department Director) Jim Harvey,\nExecutive Director of Florida Bay Initiative.

text/plain;charset=\"windows-1252\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit RE>Re: Y2K 1/4/99 Hi, glad you are getting interested in Y2K stuff. I myself have become somewhat obsessed because I really want to help lead the media in at least TRYING to do a responsible job of covering this, and preparing for it. And YES, please try to talk up the subject with journalists. My fear is that everyone will ignore this story until October and then do a bunch of alarmist stories about how everyone should stock up on ammo. If we cover y2k consistently throughout the year giving people honest updates, we may help actually fix the problem before it becomes a crisis. For example, Georgia needs to spend A LOT of money this year to fix computers. We journalists will make it easier for lawmakers to approve big technology budgets if we help make it clear to voters that this isn't just goofy pork barrel spending... I also want to consistently urge people to stock up this winter on food, water, etc. because I believe there will be a panic in Dec. At that conference I attended in mid-December in D.C., Harrison Fox, the senior staffer for the House subcommittee on technology, flat-out predicted that there \"will be rationing in the groceries stores by this time next year.\" I'm as worried about the panic as I am about the underlying problem. If the media screws up, we could really fuel insane behavior. Finding the right tone is important - and I am struggling with it myself. I quit writing my economics column as of Jan. 1 and am all-millennium, all-the-time now. My new column runs every Sunday in the Perspective Section. It is a \"countdown to 2000,\" theme - often, but not always about y2k. AND, I think we have to get editors to think about real Y2k preparedness, not just with getting our billing systems straight, but stocking up on paper, getting back-up generators, and reserving hotel rooms near the paper so that if transportation systems break down, some people will be nearby to put out a paper and sell it on street corners if necessary. Other tidbits: again, you'll be happy to hear you are living in one of the relatively safe places, at least according to the Wall St. Journal. It ranked the states according to preparedness and Florida was in the Top 6. As luck would have it, Georgia is just about rock bottom...Only Alabama, Arkansas and South Carolina could be counted upon to do worse... And about weapons: I have always been fanatically anti-gun. But I have to admit, that for the first time in 16 years, maggie and I have discussed the possibility of getting a gun. I doubt that we will because I think guns almost always make everything worse. I could never really bring myself to actually recommend it - certainly never on TV or in print. But I do think the situation is serious enough that rational people might choose to take their preparations that far. About banks: actually, most banks have really been doing an excellent job with Y2k. I wouldn't worry about pulling all money out, but I'd be on the safe side and have lots of paper records as a backup. Also, I personally plan to have about $500 cash in the house, just in case I need to buy very expensive bottled water in early Feb. 2000. But I think those who are saying you'll need $20,000 are going way, way to far. If it gets that bad, money will be worthless anyway. You'll be bartering with gold and ammo... Finally, allow me to point out that I HATE this y2k problem. I love technology, I am almost always optimistic, I do NOT believe in the Rapture and I hate paranoid doomsday crap-ola. But I don't see how a reasonable person can study this problem and not be deeply concerned. I think there is a very high probability that serious disruptions will occur and keep us from our normal routines for at least a week. If you happen to live where it's 8 degrees at this time of year, that could be very, very serious... anyway, gotta get back to work, love, mg ------=_NEXTPART_ALTERNATE_1423497050 Content-Type: text/html;charset=\"UTF-8\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit RE>Re: Y2K 1/4/99 Hi, glad you are getting interested in Y2K stuff.

I also want to consistently urge people to stock up this winter on food, water, etc. because I believe there will be a panic in Dec. At that conference I attended in mid-December in D.C., Harrison Fox, the senior staffer for the House subcommittee on technology, flat-out predicted that there \"will be rationing in the groceries stores by this time next year.\" I'm as worried about the panic as I am about the underlying problem. If the media screws up, we could really fuel insane behavior. Finding the right tone is important - and I am struggling with it myself. I quit writing my economics column as of Jan. 1 and am all-millennium, all-the-time now. My new column runs every Sunday in the Perspective Section. It is a \"countdown to 2000,\" theme - often, but not always about y2k. AND, I think we have to get editors to think about real Y2k preparedness, not just with getting our billing systems straight, but stocking up on paper, getting back-up generators, and reserving hotel rooms near the paper so that if transportation systems break down, some people will be nearby to put out a paper and sell it on street corners if necessary. Other tidbits: again, you'll be happy to hear you are living in one of the relatively safe places, at least according to the Wall St. Journal. It ranked the states according to preparedness and Florida was in the Top 6. As luck would have it, Georgia is just about rock bottom...Only Alabama, Arkansas and South Carolina could be counted upon to do worse... And about weapons: I have always been fanatically anti-gun. But I have to admit, that for the first time in 16 years, maggie and I have discussed the possibility of getting a gun. I doubt that we will because I think guns almost always make everything worse. I could never really bring myself to actually recommend it - certainly never on TV or in print. But I do think the situation is serious enough that rational people might choose to take their preparations that far. About banks: actually, most banks have really been doing an excellent job with Y2k. I wouldn't worry about pulling all money out, but I'd be on the safe side and have lots of paper records as a backup. Also, I personally plan to have about $500 cash in the house, just in case I need to buy very expensive bottled water in early Feb. 2000. But I think those who are saying you'll need $20,000 are going way, way to far. If it gets that bad, money will be worthless anyway. You'll be bartering with gold and ammo... Finally, allow me to point out that I HATE this y2k problem. I love technology, I am almost always optimistic, I do NOT believe in the Rapture and I hate paranoid doomsday crap-ola. But I don't see how a reasonable person can study this problem and not be deeply concerned. I think there is a very high probability that serious disruptions will occur and keep us from our normal routines for at least a week. If you happen to live where it's 8 degrees at this time of year, that could be very, very serious... anyway, gotta get back to work, love, mg ------=_NEXTPART_ALTERNATE_1423497050--", "recipient_name": null, "display_text": "From nobody <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"tue dec 30\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">Tue Dec 30 </div>00:43:50 <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"2014\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">2014</div>\nReceived: by mail for jeb\n (with <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"cubic circles\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">Cubic Circle's </div>cucipop (v1.21 1997/08/10) Thu Jan  7 10:39:04 1999)\nX-From_: Lawyerflo@aol.com <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"thu\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\"> Thu </div>Jan  7 10:34:35 1999\nReturn-Path: \nReceived: from imo16.mx.aol.com (imo16.mx.aol.com [198.81.17.6])\n by mail.gencom.net (8.9.1/8.9.1) with <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"esmtp\" data-ent-type=\"ORG\">ESMTP </div>id KAA01105;<div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"thu\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">\n Thu</div>, <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"7 jan 1999\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">7 Jan 1999 </div>10:34:32 -0500\nFrom: Lawyerflo@aol.com\nReceived: from Lawyerflo@aol.com by imo16.mx.aol.com (IMOv18.1) id EPLBa27801; <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"thu\" data-ent-type=\"PERSON\">\n Thu</div>, <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"7 jan 1999\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">7 Jan 1999 </div>09:34:57 -0500 (EST)\nMessage-ID: \nDate: Thu, <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"7 jan 1999\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">7 Jan 1999 </div>09:34:57 EST\nTo: jeb@jeb.org, sally@jeb.org\nMIME-Version: <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"10\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">1.0 </div>(Processed through PST Converter Pro MIME Engine V <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"21\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">2.1</div>)\nSubject: Fwd: RE>Re- Y2K\nX-Mailer: <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"aol 40\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">AOL 4.0 </div>for <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"windows\" data-ent-type=\"PRODUCT\">Windows </div>sub <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"224\" data-ent-type=\"CARDINAL\">224</div>\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\n boundary=\"----=_NEXTPART_ALTERNATE_1423497050\"\n\nThis is a multi-part message in MIME 1.0 format\n\n\n------=_NEXTPART_ALTERNATE_1423497050\nContent-Type: text/plain;charset=\"windows-1252\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"8bit\" data-ent-type=\"PERCENT\">8bit\n\n                      </div>RE>Re: Y2K                                   1/4/99\n\nHi, glad you are getting interested in <div class=\"ent\" data-normalized-ent=\"y2k\" data-ent-type=\"DATE\">Y2K </div>stuff.

Jan 1999 16:36:36 EST", "clean_text": "Jeb: The Western Palm Beach County Farm Bureau wants to congratulate you and Frank Brogan on becoming Governor and Lt. Governor of the state of Florida. Many of us having been working many years to see such a change take place in Tallahassee. Several of us attended your inauguration. Never have so many been so cold. We have a request to make. We ask that you take a look at the Palm Beach County Health Care Taxing District and ask yourself the guestion: Why does a countywide district have a surplus of $90.0 million - 110% of its annual tax revenue? Palm Beach County created a special taxing district in 1987 called the Palm Beach County Health Care Taxing District, known locally as the Health Care District. This district was created to provide funding for indigent care and establish and operate a trauma service. To create this district, three existing public hospital districts were absorbed into one super district. Each of the districts had to give its consent to be absorbed. The first time the legislation which created the special district was submitted to the voters of PBC for approval, it failed. In order for the voters and business groups to support the legislation, certain checks and balances were written into the legislation. It passed a year later. The legislation provides for a seven member board - three members to be appointed by the governor and three by Palm Beach County. The Director of the Palm Beach County Public Health Director is the seventh member. Of course, all of the directors of this special districts were democrats with a distrain for the taxpayer. Within four years, this special district has accumulated a deficit of almost $40.0 million, was in litigation with two of the three public hospitals which consented to the creation of the district, and in the process of eliminating each of the checks and balances written into the legislation by \"their\" legislators - Ron Klein and Ed Healey. Since then, this same district has accumulated a \"SURPLUS\" of almost $90.0 million, written out all of the checks and balances, and closed a hospital in Pahokee (335 peoples were put out of work, healthcare was set back some 20-years, doctors left the area and $9.0 million in payroll was lost to Pahokee, an economically deprived area). Its current surplus exceeds its annual tax revenue. Numerous excuses have been offered for the accumulation of this amount of surplus, but for a governmental agency to \"overtax\" its taxpayers to amass such a surplus is egregious. It certainly goes way beyond the scope of the enabling legislation. The Western Palm Beach County Farm Bureau is opposed to egregious governmental agencies that aren't accountable to the public. It recommends that the Board of Directors of this special district be replaced and that this district be investigated for circumventing its legislation. It has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, and the creditors of Everglades Regional Medical Center will be suing this district soon for tortious interference. I would suspect that the liability will exceed $10.0 million. This district represents a quasi-governmental working at its worst. It hires legislators to run interference, is protected by the Palm Beach Post and responsive to the needs of few. It needs to be reined in and brought under control. We hope that you will accept this challenge. Our tax dollars can be better spend that maintaining a democratic money pit.

Chiles, who\nchampioned \"Sunshine\" and was committed to openness, the problem was not just\na first day one -- it was an occasional problem whenever he/top staff wanted\nhim to have a short or meaningful conversation with leadership/lawmakers at a\ncritical time. We screwed up regularly enough. Other governors, too, have\ngrappled with balancing public rights with simple communications. Your\ncommitment will come through.\n\nWhen in doubt, don't shut them out. Err on the side of letting press in --\nit's public access, not press access that's the issue.\n\nMore personally, I wanted to thank you for being so kind to my oldest daughter\nSamantha, 15, who e-mailed you in December about a school prayer paper she was\nwiritng for a class. She only got around to reading it today (not being in\nschool during holiday break.) She was blown away (a die-hard Democrat kid).\nShe has learned a personal life lesson -- and so have I -- from your\ncommunication -- about leadership, citizenship and listening to other\nviewpoints. She is overwhelmed that\u00a0 you took the time, busy as you are, to\nhelp her.\n\nWe all want you to win on the job. Thanks again, Governor.

I can't believe I looked so tired at the Ball that it would \n    prompt the first comment from you (some politician). I was frazzeled, but at \n    least my son looked beautiful, especially in his tux. I was up at the podium \n    to say hello to Mary and didn't want to get into that crowd of hangers on (I \n    heard you say, \"let me go\" and I felt bad for you.) \n\u00a0\nI ran into Carlos and shared with him my \n    intentions . I have his support as he feels my experiences are perfect. I do \n    hope he talks to David Rancourt. I received a \"form\" letter \n    acknowledging my application and consideration from his office. I am not \n    sure David has a full package of my qualifications, though. I hope I can be \n    placed in some capacity, even if its in an advisory position (second \n    choice). \n\u00a0\nI am impressed with your appointment of \n    Steve Seibert to DCA. He' so well thought of not only here but statewide. \n    DCA\u00a0 will be a dynamic place especially now that he's there. I'd love \n    to work with him. I spported him in his work here. The SP Times ssems to \n    love him, which as you know, is key. It's the press, what can you say. It \n    begins.\n\u00a0\nOne thing I must mention is that I am a \n    registered Democrat! I haven't voted that way for some time, but it is true. \n    The first campaign I worked on was for Hubert Humphrey with my parents! \n    (yes, I am your age) I vote the person, period.\n\u00a0\nTake care, please. I truly feel for Mary and \n    Frank as they continue their fight. I have been there 3 times in 3 years. I \n    know. And\u00a0 I have offered my professional/personal assistance to them. \n    They are in good hands, though. I can continue to pray hard for their \n    ultimate success.

The outbreak is clearly very serious. Infection due to the bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis, can be very dangerous, particularly in the very young or those who have an abnormal immune system. In the Palatka area there have been a total of 9 confirmed cases (1 death) from this disease. This is very unusual in a small community of this size. It takes very close contact with a person who has the disease to transmit it and, in fact, most of the cases were either directly related, or had such close personal contact. In other words, there is a very clear association of the cases with each other. The local county health department and the state Department of Health have successfully completed a rapid and extensive (over 13,700 persons) vaccination campaign in the area. Since the formal vaccination campaign ended Jan. 2, only one additional confirmed case has occurred. Although it is very possible we may see one or two more cases at the trailing edge of this outbreak, it is very unlikely it will \"spread\" to large numbers of other people. The Department has continued to work with the community, press, legislators (mainly Rep. Kelly Smith), and the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, until it is clear that the outbreak is over. If you or your staff would like any further information on this issue please let me know. Please forgive the delay in my response. When I'm set up at the Department next week and can enter the \"Information Age\", I will check and answer my e-mail several times a day (honestly, I do have 2 PC's at home and know how to work them, but have always depended on the reliable Vickie-Jean to handle e-mail through our legislative office!).

My husband and I had the opportunity to speak before the Crime & Punishment committee in support of the 10-20-Life bill and are looking forward to addressing the Corrections committee when this bill is scheduled. I would like to meet with you at your convenience, as I have a video tape where the men arrested for our home invasion stated they should have killed us, they would have been home free. It was taped the night of their arrest while they were in the back of the patrol car. It is an excellent example for the 10-20-Life bill. I am in the process of putting together public service announcements on the 10-20-Life bill for The Free Community Papers of Florida. They are a wonderful resource for publicizing this information. With their circulation of 4.5 million households they are more likely to reach those people who commit crimes with guns.

Just what DEP needs! Allison, whom I know only by reputation, has all the stature and character and long-term relationships you need to raise your profile appropriately in the environmental arena, especially in the Everglades - the biggest project you'll oversee as Governor.

EMBEDDED_FILE Subject: TROA's Legislative Update for Friday, January 8, 1999 It's a hectic start to the new year, with the normally frenetic schedule of organizing committees, introducing new bills and formulating the new Congress' legislative agenda having to be worked in around the extraordinary trial that's just begun in the Senate. With so much going on, this report is a little longer than usual. This week's issues: \u00b7 Key Bills Reintroduced in House (Action) \u00b7 Senate Considering Special Pay/REDUX Bill \u00b7 FEHBP-65 Test Sites Expected Next Week \u00b7 Inputs Sought on Former Spouse Issues (Action) \u00b7 Tricare Region 1 Contract Dispute Settled \u00b7 Key Bills Reintroduced in House No new bills will be introduced in the Senate until at least January 19, but House members started the ball rolling this week, including the reintroduction of several bills of long-standing interest to servicemembers by perennial champions of the uniformed services community, Reps Mike Bilirakis (R-FL) and Bob Stump (R-AZ). Please contact your legislators and ask them to cosponsor these bills: H.R. 303 (Rep Bilirakis) - Would authorize full concurrent receipt of uniformed services longevity retired pay and VA disability compensation, without any offset. (Same bill number as 105th Congress) H.R. 65 (Rep Bilirakis) - Would authorize \"inverse ratio\" offset of retired pay by VA disability compensation, based on degree of disability: 100% disabled would have zero offset; 90% disabled would have 10% offset; 80% disabled, 20% offset, etc. (Same bill number as 105th Congress) H.R. 44 (Rep Bilirakis) - Low-cost, \"foot-in-the-door\" bill to ease the concurrent receipt ban for those whose severe service-connected disabilities have precluded post-service employment. Covers retirees with 20 or more years of service who received VA disability ratings of at least 70% or rated as unemployable within 4 years of leaving service. Authorizes additional $300/mo for 100% disabled, $200/mo for 90% disabled, and $100/mo for 70-80% disabled. (Same bill number as 105th Congress) H.R. 72 (Rep Stump) - Would restore measure of equity to Uniformed Services Former Spouse Protection Act by terminating division of retired pay upon remarriage of former spouse; computing divisible retired pay based on member's grade and years of service at time of divorce vs. time of retirement; limiting applicability to court orders approved within two years of divorce; and reinforcing prohibition on division of disability compensation when retired pay has been waived. (Same as H.R. 2537 in 105th Congress) H.R. 70 (Rep Stump) - Would codify existing eligibility criteria for burial at Arlington National Cemetery, with the addition of Gold Star wives (widows whose spouses died of service-connected causes). Other than the persons specifically allowed in the legislation, no other person could be buried at Arlington. (Similar to H.R. 3211 in 105th Congress, which passed the House by a vote of 412-to-0) Senate Considering Special Retention/Readiness Bill New Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner (R-VA) has signaled he may not wait for the normal Defense Authorization Bill process to address pay raise and retirement enhancement proposals in the FY2000 President's Budget. The Administration has signaled it will propose a Jan 1, 2000 raise of 4.4%, plus an additional Jul 1, 2000 raise of up to 5.5%, varying by grade and years of service, as well as at least partial repeal of the so-called REDUX retirement system that applies to members who first entered service after July 31, 1986. The REDUX system cut lifetime retired pay value for those members by almost 20% compared to previous entrants, and is cited by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a major cause of current retention problems. TROA strongly supports significant pay raise plus-ups and complete repeal of REDUX as essential to long-term retention and readiness. Special fast-track legislative action would be a great signal of how important these \"people issues\" are to national security. FEHBP-65 Test Sites Expected Next Week Word from the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is that the sites for the test of enrolling Medicare-eligible uniformed services beneficiaries in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP-65) will be announced next week. There will be at least one Medicare subvention site picked (the four sites in the running are Dover AFB, DE; Keesler AFB, MS; Colorado Springs, CO; and Ft. Lewis, WA), plus two other Tricare catchment area locations and at least three locations outside any Tricare catchment area. Inputs Sought on Former Spouse Issues The Department of Defense (DoD) has announced a short-notice call for comments by servicemembers and other interested persons on the Uniformed Services Former Spouse Protection Act (FSPA). Inputs are required before Feb 22. The information will be used by DoD for a report to Congress on the impact of FSPA on the armed forces. Interested parties can provide inputs via the Internet at http://dticaw.dtic.mil/prhome/spouserev.html (Please note that when we tried to access the background information via the three buttons at the bottom of the page, the buttons did not work. TROA has no way of fixing this problem, but we've contacted the DoD office responsible for the site, and they're working on it.) Those who wish to write should address their inputs to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management Policy), Compensation Directorate, 4000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-4000. Tricare Region 1 Contract Dispute Settled Foundation Health Federal Services, Inc., which had successfully protested the award of the five-year, $1.2 billion Tricare Region 1 contract to Sierra Military Health Services, Inc. has agreed to an undisclosed settlement from Sierra that ends the dispute. For Region 1 beneficiaries, the settlement should be good news, since it should increase the stability of their health care providers through the year 2003. If the protest had resulted in the interim selection of a new contractor, many beneficiaries could have found themselves having to switch providers again.

Governor Bush,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I was distressed to read about the lawsuit filed in state court by\nthe Florida Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. However, I am not surprised.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My biggest fear is that many more suits will begin to take place\nacross Florida in the coming months as parents become more disgruntled over\ntheir children's education. I felt strongly that this would eventually begin\nto happen. I am most concerned because I know why they had to go to the state\nlevel. They virtually had to do this because most parents get absolutely *no*\nresponse from their local school district administrators. They went to the\nstate out of \"no where else to go\".\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jeb, the problem is in the performance based education system,\ncommonly referred to as OBE (Outcome Based Education) which follows the\nmandates of Goals 2000. This system which stresses \"outcomes\" based on Mastery\nLearning techniques failed in the early 1980's and has resurfaced through the\nprogressive- minded educational bureaucracy. Not to mention, the standards\nmovement has spawned literally hundreds of edu-trends and fads into a cottage\nindustry. To name two more widely used examples are Gardner's \"Multiple\nIntelligences\" theories as well as \"cooperative-group learning\" methods which\ncan deprive the \"individual\" of their personal responsibilty to learn in one\nmethod, and in the other, has teachers trying to give each child the \"choice\"\nof \"how\" they wish to learn based on their perceived \"intelligence\". These\nbrain-researched teaching methods are turning the American classroom into a\nplethora of undisciplined hodge podge instruction, making assessments very\ndifficult. I believe I've shared my story of how my daughter was given the\noption of singing and dancing her book reports, received A's in Reading and\nWriting in fourth grade...only to find in fifth grade that she could not\nadequately express herself in a written book report. In fact, our elementary\nschool is a demonstration school for Gardner's \"Multiple Intelligence\"\ntheories and EVERY teacher is required to use it extensively in the classroom.\nAs a member of the School Advisory Committee, I talk to teachers who do not\nagree with the philosophies and theories and yet they are powerless to object.\nThey wish to remain employed.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The answer is \"getting back to what works\". Classical education has\ntaken a back seat for the last 30 years as progressive, liberal ideologies\nhave infected the American classroom. Education guru's at the universities\nreceive federal grants to find the next \"cure\" only to infect the schools with\nanother \"virus\". I am dead serious about this. Textbook companies and many\neducation researchers are making hand over fist marketing the newset \"fad\".\nOne group, \"America's Choice\" headed by none other than NCEE's Marc Tucker,\nemphasizes outcome based education and workforce training using Mastery\nLearning concepts in grades PreK through 12. In the meantime, minority\nchildren (as well as ALL children) do not need to learn how to develop a new\nway to preserve the environment or entertain their class by acting out their\nreport. They need to learn to *read, write and computate math*. I'm sure you\nagree.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As far as School to Work and workforce training, I think that type of\nindoctrination not only belongs in a democratic socialist country (which we\nare not) but that vocational education must be available and optional at an\nappropriate age, tenth grade and later. We are losing the education war\nbecause of greed and the next federal grant.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There is nothing wrong with education \"goals'. But the goals must *not*\nbe ambiguous or unobtainable. Most goals I read, including Goals 2000 are not\nreally specific, and state things such as \"all students enter school ready to\nlearn\". Now tell me, how does the government manage that without prying into\nthe private lives of its citizens? The others are pretty vague as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Students and teachers need clearly defined benchmarks ( the Sunshine\nState Standards which Frank helped to create were a good beginning) Each\nconsecutive grade should have their specific curriculum of sequential \"content\nknowledge\" as a foundation and then let teachers, the professionals that they\nare, compliment their classroom with their own style and techniques which add\nindividuality to their efforts.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This *was* classic education, and each day we see it disappearing into\noblivion. Why so? I offer you proof, that the education of today is not\n\"intellectual enhancement\" but \"systems building\". I'm sure that Frank would\nagree with me.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Same with School to Work...it is a \"system\". Would it not be better to\nallow individual school districts to decide, through their elected school\nboards and parents and education professionals which problems need to be\naddressed? So very much money is wasted on \"systems building\"...and the\nchildren lose their education. How pitiful to watch grown-ups playing money\ngames with this grant and that grant, teachers losing preparation time because\ntheir minds are focused on the next grant writing seminar and the demands to\nimplement the newest \"fad\", when classrooms do not have enough books and\nmaterials to give the children the tools they need to learn in abundance.\nSchool districts are more concerned with developing a Business and Technology\nAcademy at an already refurbished campus while 20 miles away a high-minority\nschool with low-performing students simply gets a new administrator to roam\nthe halls.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jeb, let me help *you* now, to fix the school system. Let me do\n*something* to make a difference in Florida. I may just be a concerned parent,\nan\u00a0 American \"mom\", but I can assure you I have done my homework and I believe\nthe system IS fixable. We must avoid more lawsuits and word from around the\nstate and country is that parents have \"had it\" with education reform. Kids\naren't learning.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Please let me hear from you. I have humbly received your many thank\nyou's for my helping with your campaign. Now let me help you straighten out\nwhat's wrong. You already have begun with Liberty City.

Jeb Bush and Republican legislative leaders plan to move ahead with as much as $500 million in tax cuts, some Democrats are sounding a note of caution.\nNewly elected Sen. Richard Mitchell of Jasper told the Senate Democratic caucus yesterday that he was concerned about talk of what he called \u201ctax giveaways\u201d that might keep the state from meeting its spending needs.\nHouse and Senate leaders have agreed that the state should cut taxes first and then worry about how to pay for programs. The proposed cuts include property and business taxes and expanding the sales holiday tax.\nMitchell\u2019s warning touched off a discussion at the Democratic caucus, with other senators joining in to express concerns.\nSen. Patsy Kurth of Palm Bay said the state pays less per day to keep a foster child than it costs to keep a dog in a kennel. She said it was more important to increase spending for underfunded social programs than to grant tax breaks.\n\u201cI think the people of Florida would rather see us address some of these issues where we are at the bottom,\u201d she said.\nKurth said the legislators should ask chambers of commerce to oppose programs such as the sales tax holiday for inexpensive clothing and reductions in the cost of driver\u2019s licenses.\nSen. Steven Geller of Pembroke Pines said if the state has excess money, it should put it into the rainy-day reserve to protect against a downturn in the economy, rather than cutting taxes and leaving the government vulnerable to a recession.\nGenerally, the state\u2019s budget is strong, though some specific funds, such as school construction funding, are down.\nThe Democrats voted to endorse Attorney General Bob Butterworth\u2019s request to use the $903 million available in the coming year from the tobacco settlement for health and human services.\nButterworth said such a position could strengthen the state\u2019s hand in trying to persuade the federal government not to take a large chunk of the money to reimburse it for Medicaid expenses.\nThe settlement, totaling $13 billion over 25 years, was intended, in part, to repay Medicaid money that was spent treating smoking-related illnesses.\nKurth said the state should also ensure that the money is spent to enhance health programs, not replace existing spending.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get into a lottery flimflam,\u201d she said, referring to the use of lottery proceeds to supplant education spending rather than to enhance it."}, "sender_name": "Jeb Bush", "datetime": "{\"$date\": 915851224000}", "keyword_topics": ["Education"], "recipient_email": "sally@jeb.org", "graph_contacts": ["Jeb Bush", "Sally@jeb.org"], "subject": "FW: ", "to_contacts": ["Sally@jeb.org"], "from": "Jeb Bush jeb@jeb.org", "parsed_tos": [["harrell sally", "sally@jeb.org"]], "entities": {"entities": ["dday"], "entities_dupes": ["dday"], "types": {"ORG": ["dday"]}}, "to": "Harrell Sally sally@jeb.org", "sentiment_score": 0.7713192019252203, "message_id": "<7E2A7531-E387-4BB0-8B74-01CC2FAFA6BF@1423496964>", "conversation_topic": "01Jan", "parsed_froms": [["Jeb Bush", "jeb@jeb.org"]], "message_date": "Fri, 08 Jan 1999 21:07:04 -0600", "clean_text": "This is the big issue that I need your thoughts very soon. we are at D-Day on the magnitude of tax cuts and how this compares with reserves and spending on education and social services.

As an attorney at the District, I\nknow \"where all the bodies are buried.\" I would welcome the opportunity to\ndiscuss it with you (with Tom). In the meantime, I would also strongly\nendorsed Kevin McCarty for the District Governing Board (to replace Richard\nMachek). Kevin would bring valuable financial insight to the Board. That is\ngreatly needed.\u00a0 Additionally, I believe that Mike Collins would be a better\nchoice for the Governing Board than Gene Pettis. Gene would continue to hurt\nthe District and I believe that he would fail to adequately represent the\nviews of your administration. As an independent taxing authority, the\nDistrict can wield considerable power. Accordingly, it needs REPUBLICANS on\nthe Board.

information is provided in next week\u2019s column. The Navarre area meeting has been held, and others will have been completed in Crestview and Fort Walton Beach. Thanks to the folks who took the time to attend and express ideas for local legislation. With education on everyone\u2019s priority list of subjects, I thought I\u2019d pass along some information from The Heritage Foundation. Very interesting facts and information. At the heart of the national Elementary and Secondary Education Act funding is Title I - Aid to Disadvantaged Children, which consumes $8 billion of the roughly $13 billion spent on ESEA programs each year. Polls show that education tops Americans\u2019 list of pressing concerns. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in late October, for example, finds that 88 percent of those surveyed think improving the quality of public school education is \"very important.\" Americans want leadership with action on this issue; they do not care who fixes their broken schools, so long as the job is done right. In the inner cities, only 40 percent of 4th and 8th graders performed at the basic level on the national Assessment of Educational Progress reading test. The results of the latest Third International Math and Science Study reveals that U.S. seniors have lost their competitive edge over their counterparts in Western Europe in these core subjects. In Advanced Physics, U.S. high school seniors finished last behind 20 other countries, including Latvia and the Czech Republic. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported on November 13, 1998, that - even though the United States dictates one of the largest shares of GDP to education, it has fallen behind other economic powers in high school graduation rates. Only 72 percent of 18-year-old Americans graduated in 1996, trailing all other developed countries. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has done little to improve the quality of education. Select studies of its programs are inconclusive at best. The Title I program, which has spent over $100 billion since its inception has done little to boost achievement for poor children. In fact, no correlation can be drawn between ESEA programs or federal dollars spent on education and students\u2019 academic outcomes. For more information on the above, you can contact through or you can give them a call at 202-608-6045. What do you think of the Heritage Foundations findings? What do you think of this one? Senator Patsy Kurth of Palm Bay has notified me that she is drafting a bill to exempt military personnel and their dependents from the 12 month residency requirement for instate tuition to our colleges and universities. Current to qualify for instate tuition a person must meet two requirements: (1) Establish residency in Florida (buy a home, register your cars, etc.) And (2) Live in the state for 12 months. Once both of these are accomplished, an individual is qualified for instate tuition. The bill would require the person to establish residency, but would waive the 12 month requirement for retired military personnel. On the surface this sounds good, but there are some other concerns. These individuals could move their official residency 12 months before retirement, but most do not because their retain their residency in those states with the lowest costs to them for auto registrations, taxes, etc. I\u2019ve asked for more information and will be passing along information to you as it is received. What do you think? The Florida Department of Transportation will conduct a public meeting concerning the transportation improvements for I-10/I-II0 PD&E Study - Interstate 10 from US 29 (Pensacola Boulevard) to US 90 (Scenic Highway) and Interstate 110 from Maxwell Street to Interstate 10 (State Project No. 48270-1423). The meeting will be held on Thursday, January 14, 1999 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Olive Baptist Church located at 1836 Olive Road in Pensacola. The meeting is being held to afford persons the opportunity to express their views concerning the location; design; and the social, economic and environmental effects of the alternative improvements being considered by the study team. Enterprise Florida Inc., should drop out of efforts to bring venture capital to the state and needs to improve its business recruitment and work force training efforts, according to a new report by an office of the Florida legislature. The report on the State\u2019s economic development organization also warns that the public-private partnership probably will have trouble meeting its goals for private funding. The message in the report is that Enterprise Florida\u2019s funding from the Legislature should be continued, but there needs to be a fresh look at its role in some area, according to Tom Roth, a senior analyst for the legislature\u2019s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. Florida has joined nine other states and the federal government in suing four companies for allegedly conspiring to sharply increase the prices of two generic drugs in violation of federal antitrust laws. Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said in one instance a bottle of 500 clorazepate tablets increased in price from $11.36 to $377. In another instance, he said, a bottle of 500 lorazepam tablets increased in price from $7.30 to $191.50. Butterworth estimated that 40 percent of those using the drugs paid for them out of their own pockets and said Florida\u2019s large elderly population has been especially hard hit by the price increases.
